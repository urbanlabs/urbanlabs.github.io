  title: Principal
  intro: Elizabeth Sall loves making civic processes function better based on her combined
         experiences in software development, urban data analytics, data standards management and governance, public-sector management, and policy development with a variety of
         clients and needs.  As a former public sector leader, she understands the day-to-day demands and realities of working in government and
         the challenges that make it difficult to innovate in order to provide a better user experience to the public.

  service-intro: Elizabeth complements her professional life with a variety of efforts related to international and local conservation,
           poverty alleviation, and global health (and particularly where these issues intersect) through vehicles such as impact
           investing, social entrepreneurship, board service on several organizations and connecting some dots where they need connecting.
           She has a particular passion for empowering local communities to affect (and hopefully control) their own destiny.
