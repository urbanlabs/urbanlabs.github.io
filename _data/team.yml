  service: Elizabeth complements her professional life with a variety of efforts related to international and local conservation, 
           poverty alleviation, and global health (and particularly where these issues intersect) through vehicles such as impact 
           investing, social entrepreneurship, board service on several organizations and connecting some dots where they need connecting.
